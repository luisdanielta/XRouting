# Lamdba Function: SpaceX Data Extraction

This function extracts, transforms, and stores data from the SpaceX API into DynamoDB using a **hexagonal architecture**.

## 1. Development Environment Setup

### Recommended: `.devcontainer`
For a fully pre-configured development environment, use **VS Code** and select **"Reopen in Container"**. The project includes a `.devcontainer` and a `Dockerfile` to streamline setup.

### Manual Setup
If you prefer to run the code locally, ensure you have **Python 3.11+** installed and install dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 2. Project Architecture
This project follows a hexagonal architecture, separating concerns into distinct modules:

- `adapters/` → Interfaces with external services (SpaceX API, DynamoDB)
- `core/` → Business logic and domain entities
- `ports/` → Services connecting business logic to the infrastructure
- `deploy/` → Deployment scripts
- `migration/` → Data migration scripts

## 3. Lambda Function Overview
The Lambda function runs an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process every 6 hours, fetching `SpaceX` data and storing it in DynamoDB. The main workflow is:

- Extract Data from the SpaceX API.
- Transform Data into structured entities:
- Convert raw API data into `Components`, `SubComponents`, `Comments`, and `Analytical Metrics`.
- Generate custom analytics based on launches and hardware performance.
- Load Data into DynamoDB using dedicated repositories.

## 4. Code Structure
The Lambda function is implemented in a single script and follows this core flow:

```python
def lambda_handler(event: Dict[str, str], context: object) -> Dict[str, str | int]:
    spaceXData = fetchSpaceXData()
    components, comments, subComponents, analytics = transformData(spaceXData)
    return saveToDynamoDB(components, comments, subComponents, analytics)
```
